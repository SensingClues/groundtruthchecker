# groundtruthchecker
helper tool to update your ground truth status map

Land use mapping based on ESA Land Cover classes. 

PROCESS
BLC provides polygon delineating the Area of Responsibility
3edata experts make a map layer with training points that need to be visited (training points map)

The training points map is loaded into the Cluey Data Collector
BLC staff use the app to visit these locations are assign their respective ESA classes

This ground truth checker is used to regularly update the training points map (remove all points that have been visited and classified)



This is a project run by Life Connected, Sensing Clues and 3edata.
